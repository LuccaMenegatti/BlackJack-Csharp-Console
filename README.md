# BlackJack-Csharp-Console
This is a simple console-app Blackjack project developed in C#. The game follows the classic rules of Blackjack, where you play against the computer (the dealer) to try to achieve a higher score than the dealer without exceeding 21.

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Open the project in your C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Run the project, and the game will start in the console.
4. The game begins with you and the dealer each receiving two cards. The cards have the following values:

   - Ace: 1 point
   - Numbered cards (2-10): face value
   - Jacks, Queens, and Kings: 10 points each

5. You will have the option to take another card or keep your current cards.
6. The objective of the game is to get as close as possible to 21 points without exceeding it. If you exceed 21, you automatically lose.
